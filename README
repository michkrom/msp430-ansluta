Ikea Ansluta Remote Hacking
===========================

At this point the project is at 'bang on the pipes' stage (ie it flashes the LED).

There is a dump of original FW and annotated disassembly as described here:

Hardware
--------

The Ansluta remote consists of: MPS430G2231 MPU, CC2500 Transiver, LED, Key Switch

MSP430       Device
----------------------------------------
     P1.0    LED
RXD  P1.1    unused?
TXD  P1.2    CC2500 CS
     P1.3    CC2500 GDO0
     P1.4    CC2500 GDO2
SCLK P1.5    CC2500 SCLK
SOMI P1.6    CC2500 SI
SIMO P1.7    CC2500 SO
     P2.6    unused (N-FET's Gate in transformer)
     P2.7    Key (switch)

Target control achieved via MSP430 Launchpad, see:

Building
--------

This project is written for msp430-gcc on Linux with a regular makefile. 

To build:

make

This builds the "firmware" in the "bin" subdirectory in various formats.


Target Operations
-----------------

To check connection

make check-target

To flash the firmware to your Launchpad through "mspdebug", you could use the "flash-target" make target (makes the target beforehand)

make flash-target

To start mspdebug

make debug-target


Doxygen Docs
------------

If you installed doxygen on your system, you could generate the HTML-based documentation by calling:

make gen-docs

This will create the documentation under "doc/gen/html".
